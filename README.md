# Cross-Lingual-Sentiment-Analysis-Project

Sentiment analysis of test data analyses text, extracts features and tries to identify the emotion behind the sentence. 
Sentiment analysis on monolingual datasets have been performed to great extent with satisfying accuracy.
In a country like India, which has multiple spoken languages, we often encounter ourselves with code-mixed sentences.
This acts as a barrier to monolingual NLP models that cannot perform well on such code-mixed data.
We focus mainly on Kannada-English code-mixed dataset taken directly from â€œDravidian-CodeMix-FIRE 2021" challenge
